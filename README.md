WinBridge
=========

A utility to use Mac OS X in a mixed environment with Windows

This utililty adds following commands to the Services menu:

* Copy Windows Path: copies Windows UNC path to the clipboard as smb: URL.
* Convert Windows Path: transforms Windows UNC path to smb: URL.
* Open Windows Path: open Windows UNC path.

There are quite good number of similar utilities.
I tried a few of them but they were not sufficient for my needs in:

* Most of them mount as many volumes as you open in the /Volumes directory.
* Most of them fail to handle international characters in UNC paths.
